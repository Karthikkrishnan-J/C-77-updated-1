    <h1>\\\Project on console\\\</h1>
    <p>
        Visual studio is an application for text based coding. We can use bootstrap also in this application. We have to
        download it into windows or mac.
    </p>
    <p>
        Console screen is were we see codes that we dont see in the live screen. We print it by using variable and
        console.log() . We store what we want in the variable and then write it on console.log().Type the variable
        name in the brackets and Then right click, click inspect and go to console. We can see all the codes that 
        we are unable to see in the live screen.

    <script>
        console.log("My first console project");
        var first_name = "Ranbir";
        var last_name = "Kapoor";
        var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(full_name);
        var a = 10;
        var b = 5;
        var add = a + b;
        console.log(add)
        
        var subtract = a - b;
        console.log(subtract)
        
        var multiply = a * b;
        console.log(multiply)
       
        var divide = a / b
        console.log(divide)
